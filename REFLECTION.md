1. Were your predictions accurate?

     Partially, the prediction that hiking was the best activity is correct because it rates a 10. While "physical" was the most frequent (3 days), the prediction that "social" was an important competitor in total volume was slightly off. Physical activities totaled 5.5 hours, while Social totaled 5 hours, but Creative totaled 4.5 hours, making all categories relatively balanced in time, rather than social being the most dominating.

2. What surprised you about your week?

     Even though I predicted social events would be major highlights, the data showed that easy-going, creativity, or active workouts like Painting, Digital Illustration, and Hiking actually provided higher enjoyment scores in the 9-10 range, compared to the social, coffee-based activities in the 8 range.
Although "Low Hours High Enjoyment" was defined as under 2 hours, the activities that brought the most joy were hiking and painting, which often took longer, meaning I actually prefer investing more time in high-quality personal hobbies.

3. Which higher order function was most useful and why?

     The filter() method was used within filterByCondition and was the most useful.
Due to the ability to be the most flexible tool. By using a callback function (testFn), it allowed for dynamic searching and finding short, high-enjoyment activities in one line of code. I didn't need to write entirely new functions for different criteria. I learned that it's really useful for analyzing specific subsets of data.
